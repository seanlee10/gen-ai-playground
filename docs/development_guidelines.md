# Development Guidelines

## Code Organization

Maintain a clear and consistent structure throughout the repository:

1. Separate experiments into individual directories
2. Document all significant code components
3. Include requirements and setup instructions
4. Version control model artifacts appropriately

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Implement proper error handling
- Add unit tests for critical components

### Model Development
- Document model architectures
- Track experiment configurations
- Version control training data
- Log training metrics and results

### Data Management
- Document data sources and preprocessing steps
- Implement data validation procedures
- Maintain data versioning
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches for new experiments
2. Document changes and experimental results
3. Review code before merging
4. Update documentation as needed
